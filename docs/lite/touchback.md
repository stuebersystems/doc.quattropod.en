# Touch Back Support

The touch-back function of the QuattroPod allows you to send gestures with Up to 10 fingers of a multitouch-enabled screen wirelessly back to a Windows computer. All known Windows touch gestures are supported.

When switching to another participant, touch-back functionality is also available to them. This allows for interactivity and creativity of multiple participants on one screen.
