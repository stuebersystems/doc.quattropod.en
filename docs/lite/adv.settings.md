### Screensaver {#Screensaver}

Turn off the receiver`s screen or HDMI output after a certain period of inactivity. By default, this function is disabled.

![](/assets/img/screensaver.jpg)

Inactivity means that the Home screen is displayed on the screen and no transmitters are transmitting content.

While the screensaver is running, the receiver remains in operation. The web interface is accessible and the transmitters can still be connected.

You can wake up the receiver or restore HDMI output by retransmitting content from the transmitter.

### Reset to default settings {#reset}

Use this function to reset the receiver and transmitters to the default settings. This will not affect the [Wallpaper](#MyScreen) of the Home screen, the [SSID](#SSID), or the firmware version.

* If your transmitter does not unlock after resetting, check the [receiver](quickstart.md#setup) and [pair](pairing.md) the transmitter with the receiver again.
