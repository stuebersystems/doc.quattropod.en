## How to query ports used by QuattroPod

Are certain features such as Chromecast not working when connecting to QuattroPod via your network infrustructure? Microsoft has a Graphical User Interface tool called PortQueryUI which can be used to troubleshoot these kinds of scenarios with port connectivity issues. You can use this tool to troubleshoot TCP/IP connection issues. The utility reports the port status of TCP and UDP ports on a device that you select.

### Download PortQueryUI.exe

* Download and launch the tool [portqueryui.exe](https://download.microsoft.com/download/3/f/4/3f4c6a54-65f0-4164-bdec-a3411ba24d3a/portqryui.exe). Accept the license agreement and proceed:

* Choose a location to extract the files:

* You don`t need to install `PortQueryUI.exe`, simply run it by double clicking on it:

### Query Ports

* Make a note of the Infrastructure IP address which is displayed on the bottom left of the landing page:

In the `destination IP` field, enter the infrastructure IP address. Then specify the ports to be checked and click `Query`, for example:

For the `ChromeCast` service:

* `Ports to query` = **80,443,8008,8009**
* `Protocol` = **TCP**

### More Information

PortQueryUI.exe reports the status of a TCP/IP port in one of the following three ways:

`LISTENING`

A process is listening on the port on the QuattroPod device that you selected. PortQueryUI.exe received a response from the port.

`NOT LISTENING`

No process is listening on the target port on the target system. Please check your infrstructure in order to allow network connections for this port.

`Filtered`

The port on the computer that you selected QuattroPod device is being filtered. PortQueryUI.exe didn`t receive a response from the port. A process may or may not be listening on the port. By default, TCP ports are queried three times, and UDP ports are queried one time before a report indicates that the port is filtered.
