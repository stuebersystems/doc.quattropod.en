# Data Security

The QuattroPod receiver and transmitters use the **5 Ghz (802.11 ac)** wireless standard and authentication protocol **WPA2-PSK (AES)** by default to encrypt data over Wi-Fi.

The receiver provides further security of data by restricting services to only one embedded **web server (thttpd)** and **QuattroPod software service**. Changes made to the receiver by the user via the web server are permanently stored on a non-volatile NAND flash.
