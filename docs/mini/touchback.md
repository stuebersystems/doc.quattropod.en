# Touch Back Support

The QuattroPod`s touch-back feature allows you to wirelessly send gestures back to a Windows computer using up to 10-fingers of a multitouch-enabled screen. All known Windows touch gestures are supported.

When switching to another participant, touch back functionality is also available to them. This allows interactivity and creativity from multiple participants on one screen.
