# What is Chromecast?

Chromecast is the streaming technology from Google. Using the Google Chrome browser, you can stream a browser tab, an audio/video file, or even your entire computer screen to the QuattroPod quickly and conveniently. 

The QuattroPod allows Up to 4 Windows, Android and ChromeOS devices to broadcast to a split screen together via the Chromecast protocol without having to use the app.

Google Cast streaming technology is now a built-in part of the Chrome browser and therefore compatible with the following devices: 

* Google Chrome OS,
* Microsoft Windows 7 or later
* Android 5.0 or higher
* [Linux (with reduced capabilities)](linux.md).

## Enable Google Cast

By default, Chromecast is enabled on QuattroPod devices. However, if you want to re-enable the feature, you can find the corresponding `Google Cast` option under [Advanced Settings](adv.settings.md#Chromecast):
