# Conference control

Conference control is a means only for the presenter to run the course of a presentation as he or she wishes by having various control options. The host can choose how and when other participants can transmit their screens during a presentation. The buttons for `repositioning`, `full screen`, or even `disconnect`, can be found on the right under columns.
