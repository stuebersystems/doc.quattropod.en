# Update Firmware

## Why update the firmware? 

In order to benefit from all the latest QuattroPod features you can install the latest firmware update quickly and conveniently via the Internet. When you install a new firmware, the previous settings will be included.

You will need [Internet Access](internet.md). When the QuattroPod is connected to your LAN or to your WLAN, an IP address assigned by your network called `Infrustructure IP` will be displayed on the screen as shown below:

## Connect transmitters and switch on

When updating the firmware it's important not to overlook the transmitters. Pay careful attention to keep the receiver and all transmitters equally up-to-date in order to avoid compatability issues.
