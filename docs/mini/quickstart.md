## Screen Mirroring with Transmitter {#Transmitter}

### Android

!!! tip "Note"

     The transmitter allows you to easily mirror your screen. However, if you prefer to mirror your content without a transmitter, you can use a [streaming protocol](#a-streaming-protocols). You can also use the free QuattroPod [app](#b-the-quattropod-app-under-android) on Android.

You need to enable USB debugging once, then connect the transmitter and press the main button.

## Screen Transmission without Transmitter

With QuattroPod you have two options without the transmitter:

* If you just want to quickly transfer your screen, you can get started right away following the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) principle by using the built-in screen transfer functionality of your device or streaming protocols. That means in this case you don't have to download an app at all!

* The free QuattroPod app provides you with an intuitive interface to screen transfer your Android device.

### a) Streaming protocols
 
All popular streaming protocols are supported. Comprehensive instructions according to your desired protocol can be found at the following links:

* [AirPlay](airplay.md) on iOS and macOS.

* [Google Cast](chromecast.md) on Google Chrome OS, Windows, Android and Linux.

### b) QuattroPod App for Android.

* On your device, search for the SSID shown on the screen:

#### Install App {#InstallApp}

Locate the app **QuattroPod** in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.actionsmicro.quattropod.winnerwave) and install it from there:
