# What is AirPlay?

AirPlay is Apple's streaming technology for wirelessly streaming from Apple devices to AirPlay-enabled receiver devices such as speakers, AV receivers, stereo systems, and TVs.

QuattroPod allows up to four macOS and iOS devices to share a split screen simultaneously via the AirPlay protocol without the need for the app.

## Enable AirPlay

By default, AirPlay is enabled on QuattroPod devices. However, if you want to re-enable the feature, you can find the corresponding `AirPlay` option under [Advanced Settings](adv.settings.md#AirPlayMode):
