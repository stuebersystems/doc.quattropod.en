## Screen transmission with transmitter {#Transmitter}

### Android

!!! tip "Note"

     The transmitter allows you to easily mirror your screen. However, if you prefer to mirror your content without a transmitter, you can use a [streaming protocol](#a-streamingprotocol). Also, you can use the free QuattroPod [app](#b-the-quattropod-app-under-android) on Android.

You need to enable USB debugging once, then connect the transmitter and press the main button.

## Screen transmission without transmitter

With QuattroPod you have two options without the transmitter:

* If you just want to quickly transmit your screen, you can get started right away according to the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) principle by using the built-in screen transmission functionality of your device or streaming protocols. That means in this case you don't need to download an app at all!

* The free QuattroPod app provides you with an intuitive interface for screen sharing your Android device.

### a) Streaming protocols
 
All major streaming protocols are supported. Comprehensive instructions according to your desired protocol can be found at the following links:

* [AirPlay](airplay.md) on iOS and macOS.

* [Google Cast](chromecast.md) on Google Chrome OS, Windows, Android and Linux.

### b) The QuattroPod app on Android.

* On your device, search for the SSID that appears on the screen:

![](/assets/img/QSG-QP.R01.Mobile.png)

Install #### App {#InstallApp}

Search for the app **QuattroPod** in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.actionsmicro.quattropod.winnerwave) and install it from there:

Connect #### App with QuattroPod

If you have [connected](#setup) the QuattroPod correctly, the following landing page appears on the screen:

![](/assets/img/quattropod.landingpage.png)

Now proceed as follows:

* From your Android device, connect using the SSID displayed at the top left of the screen as shown above. The password is also displayed by default.

* Now call up the QuattroPod app on your Android device. The first time you open the app, you will need to give one-time permission for the app to be displayed above other apps you are using. Select 'OK'.

![](/assets/img/android_app_overlay_OK.png)

* Turn on the 'Grant Permission' menu item, then press the 'Back' button on your Android device to return to the app.
