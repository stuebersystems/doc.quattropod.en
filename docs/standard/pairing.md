# Pairing transmitters

The QuattroPod receiver can be paired with up to 32 transmitters simultaneously. The transmitters are paired with the supplied receiver by default. However, you can purchase additional transmitters or use transmitters with a different receiver. To do this, the transmitters must be paired with the corresponding receiver.

There are two ways to pair a transmitter with a receiver

The transmitter is connected to the USB port of the receiver and the units pair automatically. Some find this option easiest if the receiver is within easy reach. If the receiver is mounted on the ceiling or is simply difficult to reach, pair the [transmitter via USB stick](#sender-per-usb-stick-pair).

* Switch the transmitter to 'PC'.

## Pair transmitter via USB stick

### Download pairing file via web interface

With some systems, the receiver is out of range and requires a lot of effort to reach. However, you have the option of downloading a coupling file and copying the receiver's information to the transmitter via USB stick. You can use FAT, FAT32, or NTFS as the file system of the USB stick.

* Either download the pairing file 'pairingInfo.json' from the menu item 'Device Management' of the [web interface](adv.settings.md).

and copy the file to a USB stick. You do not need to delete any other files first.
**IMPORTANT:** It is essential to save the pairing file at the **root of the USB stick**.

### Downloading the pairing file via receiver

* Before mounting the receiver on the ceiling or even when the receiver is easily accessible, you can insert a USB stick into the USB port of the receiver and press the pairing button on the top of the receiver. After a few seconds, the pairing file is copied to the USB stick and the receiver's pairing button lights up white. You can keep this file in your network or on the USB stick until pairing is needed.
