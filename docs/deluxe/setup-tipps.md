## Cables and accessories

### C14 to C13+Euro Y Type Splitter Adapter

If the projector is attached to the ceiling and only the power cable from the projector is available, or if you want a single cable solution from the wall outlet to the display device, the question arises how to power the projector or screen and the QuattroPod together.

With a **C14 to C13+Euro Y Type Splitter Adapter**, you can convert the IEC power cord to Euro power outlet and C13 cable. This in combination with the [power supply](#powersupply) can allow power for both devices.

### Mounting the receiver

You can fix the receiver with a good tape without damaging the screen. We can recommend the [UHU Doppelband](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B08XY33P7Z/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_ATTVGNT009VNJK1MEE60?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1):
